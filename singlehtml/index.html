<h1>Gini Pay Business SDK for Android<a class="headerlink" href="#gini-pay-business-sdk-for-android" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Gini Pay provides an information extraction system for analyzing business invoices and
transfers them to the Android banking app, where the payment process will be completed.
The Gini Pay Business SDK for Android provides functionality to review the document and
its extractions and pay using a payment provider.</p>

<h3>Authentication<a class="headerlink" href="#authentication" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The entry point for Business SDK is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness</span></tt> class which depends
on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> (Gini Pay API lib) to interact with the backend.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> class can be built either with client credentials (clientId and clientSecret)
or with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SessionManager</span></tt> if you have a token. For these two cases there are helper methods:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getGiniApi(context:</span> <span class="pre">Context,</span> <span class="pre">clientId:</span> <span class="pre">String,</span> <span class="pre">clientSecret:</span> <span class="pre">String,</span> <span class="pre">emailDomain:</span> <span class="pre">String)</span></tt></li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">getGiniApi(context:</span> <span class="pre">Context,</span> <span class="pre">sessionManager:</span> <span class="pre">SessionManager)</span></tt></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">SessionManager</span></tt> is an interface which you need to implement to send the token.</p>
<p>For more details about <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-api-lib-android/">Gini Pay API lib</a>.</p>
</div>
<span id="document-flow"></span><div class="section" id="flow">
<h3>Flow<a class="headerlink" href="#flow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>GiniBusiness is the main class for interacting with Gini Pay Business SDK.
It provides a way to submit a document for reviewing its extracted payment details and
let&#8217;s the user make the payment with one of the payment providers.</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>The recommended flow is to:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness.checkRequirements()</span></tt> to make sure that the flow can be completed.</li>
<li>Call one of the overloads of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setDocumentForReview</span></tt>, to submit a document.</li>
<li>Display <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></tt>.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<div class="section" id="checking-requirements">
<h4>Checking requirements<a class="headerlink" href="#checking-requirements" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Requirements are not enforced, but recommended. Review Fragment will still start, but
the flow cannot be completed if not all requirements are met.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">checkRequirements()</span></tt> returns a list of missing requirements. Empty list means all requirements are met.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setting-a-document-for-review">
<h4>Setting a document for review<a class="headerlink" href="#setting-a-document-for-review" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setDocumentForReview</span></tt> can be called with:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Document</span></tt> instance in the case the upload was performed with Gini Pay Api lib (see <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Gini</span></tt> class).</li>
<li>Document id, this will probably be the case when there&#8217;s backend integration between the Business Client and Gini.</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>When calling it with an id the SDK will make a network call to obtain a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Document</span></tt> instance.
So it is preferred to use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Document</span></tt> instance if you already have it.
The same applies to the optional <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">PaymentDetails</span></tt>, if they are present they will be displayed
and network calls to get extractions will be skipped.</p>
<p>The exposed flows of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniBussines</span></tt> are used by the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></tt> to observe the state of the document and extractions, but they are public
so that they can be observed anywhere, the main purpose for this is to observe errors.</p>
<p>Note: If you observe payment details flow, you can check PaymentDetails.isPayable as an extra condition before displaying the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ReviewFragment</span></tt>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="display-reviewfragment">
<h4>Display ReviewFragment<a class="headerlink" href="#display-reviewfragment" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>ReviewFragment displays document pages and extractions and it lets the user pay using a payment provider</p>
<p>To instantiate it you need to create a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FragmentFactory</span></tt> and set it to fragment manager:</p>
<div class="highlight-kotlin"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">class</span> <span class="nc">ReviewFragmentFactory</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">private</span> <span class="k">val</span> <span class="py">giniBusiness</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">GiniBusiness</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">FragmentFactory</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>ReviewFragment handles errors by default, displaying snackbars for errors, but it
can be configured to ignore them, in which case all flows of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">GiniBusiness</span></tt> should
be observed for errors.</p>

</div>
<span id="document-customization"></span><div class="section" id="customization">
<h3>Customization<a class="headerlink" href="#customization" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Customization of is achieved through Android&#8217;s resourcing system.
This means that all <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/gini/gini-pay-business-sdk-android/tree/main/ginipaybusiness/src/main/res">resources of the library</a>
can be overridden by providing resources with the same name in the

<p>Material components are used so for in the ReviewFragment, so those
components will pick attributes of the hosting activity if it uses
a Material Theme.</p>
<p>Some attributes are set inside the library (styles that start with
